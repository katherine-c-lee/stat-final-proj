# School Crime and Safety<br/>STAT  471 Final Project<br/>Katherine Lee, Mark Rauschkolb<br/>December 19, 2021

Sandy Hook Elementary School and Santa Fe High School are synonymous with school shootings and violence. While national trends show that violence and victimization has declined from 1992 to 2017, there is a sentiment that the number of school shootings is increasing, mainly due to a steep increase in multiple-victim homicides (as opposed to single-victim homicides), revealing that the topic of school violence is still very relevant. On top of this, smaller instances of school crime are often forgotten even though they are still abundant and extremely detrimental to educational outcomes and children safety. For our final project, we decided to look into which variables were predictive of crimes and incidents of violence across US schools throughout 2015. While only analyzing 2015 school trends inherently limits the generalizability of our results, we believe the analysis draws high-level analyses about school crime trends.

We draw from two different types of datasets: school-level data and county-level data. We used school-level data from the Urban Institute Education Portal to understand what school-specific features may be predictive of school crime. Using this portal, we were able to access data from: National Center for Education Statistics’ Common Core of Data (CCD), the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), the US Department of Education’s EDFacts, and IPUMS’ National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS). Specifically, we pulled: school-level directory / geographic data, school finance data, teacher and staff data, discipline instances, and crime incidences. We also used county-level data to analyze school crime macro-trends. This county-level data came from US Economic Research Service, US Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, and Census Bureau's Demographic Data. Specifically, we pulled: unemployment, education, poverty, wage, and demographic data. Our response variable was total crime per 1,000 students enrolled. We created this variable by adding a variety of crime incidents (rape, assault, robbery, etc.) and dividing it by the schools' respective student enrollment. 

Before running any analyses, we split our data into a training dataset and a testing dataset. Because of the heavily-skewed nature of our response variable, total crime incidents per 1,000 students, we square-root transformed the response, which resulted in more symmetric data. Then, on our train data, we explored our data to understand correlations between the features (through correlation plots) and between the features and the response. To understand the predictors of total crime and make a predictive model, we  built six different cross-validated models, with the end goal of selecting the best model with the best performance. Specifically, we built an OLS regression, ridge regression, Lasso regression, pruned regression decision tree, random forest, and boosting model. Regression based methods did not perform particularly well - OLS scored worse than the intercept only model, and both Ridge and Lasso, scored very similarly. Tree-based methods preformed significantly better. The pruned tree outpreformed all regerssion methods, and Random Forest and Boosting models then preformed significantly better. In the end, the optimal boosting model preformed as the best predictive model.

Throughout all models, we consistently saw similar variables surface as highly predictive of total crime. In general, we noticed that school specific variables influenced school crime much more than general demographic variables. Furthermore, key indicators such as threats and suspensions need to be taken seriously as they indicate higher levels of crime. Lastly, we were able to shine light on the importance of investing in teachers rather than psychologists, counselors and extra security guards.
